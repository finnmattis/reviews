NESR's systematic review methodology includes a step to grade the strength of the evidence underlying conclusion statements, which is critical for ensuring that end users understand the level of certainty in conclusions when using them to make decisions. Over time, NESR has ensured its grading process not only remains state of the art but is also designed specifically for systematic reviews that inform Federal guidelines and programs on nutrition and public health. The NESR grading process used by the 2020 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee included 5 grading elements: risk of bias, consistency, directness, precision, and generalizability. Evidence was grouped by study design and assessed against these elements, and the grade assigned to the entire body of evidence took into consideration the strengths and limitations of each design. Based on this assessment, 1 of 4 grades was assigned: strong, moderate, limited, or grade not assignable. The grade was clearly communicated by integrating specific language into each conclusion statement (e.g., “strong evidence demonstrates” or “limited evidence suggests”), and supported by rationale documented in the review. NESR's grading process aligns with approaches used by other organizations that conduct systematic reviews, while retaining aspects unique to NESR's role in informing Federal nutrition and public health guidelines and programs. It provides a framework that promotes consistency in grading across food- and nutrition-related reviews, while offering flexibility that allows for thorough consideration of the body of evidence underlying an individual conclusion statement. NESR's rigorous and transparent methods for grading the strength of evidence in food- and nutrition-related systematic reviews ensure that decisions related to nutrition and public health are based on the strongest available evidence.</p></div><div class="sec"><strong class="kwd-title">Keywords: </strong><span class="kwd-text">grading, NESR, nutrition evidence systematic review, strength of evidence, certainty of evidence, systematic review methodology, systematic reviews, Dietary Guidelines for Americans, public health, federal food policy and programs</span></div></div><div class="tsec sec" id="abstract-a.n.b.s" lang="en"><h2 class="headless nomenu"></h2><!--article-meta--><div><p class="p p-first-last">
<strong>Statement of Significance</strong>: This article describes the rigorous and transparent methods developed and used by USDA's Nutrition Evidence Systematic Review (NESR) team to grade the strength of evidence in food- and nutrition-related systematic reviews used to inform US Federal nutrition guidelines and programs. NESR's grading process was used in systematic reviews conducted by the 2020 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee, which informed the development of the <em>Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020–2025</em>.</p></div></div><div class="tsec sec" id="sec1"><h2 class="head no_bottom_margin" id="sec1title">Introduction</h2><p class="p p-first">The USDA's Nutrition Evidence Systematic Review (NESR) team specializes in conducting food- and nutrition-related systematic reviews. NESR systematic reviews are research projects that answer important public health questions by using rigorous and transparent methods to search for, evaluate, analyze, and synthesize the body of scientific evidence on topics relevant to US Federal policy and programs. NESR is housed within the USDA's Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion (CNPP), and its work supports CNPP's mission to improve the health of Americans by developing and promoting dietary guidance that links scientific research to the nutrition needs of consumers. In addition, NESR's systematic review methodology promotes scientific integrity. Because of its evidence-based approach, NESR's work helps uphold the Data Quality Act (<a class="bibr popnode" href="#bib1" rid="bib1">1</a>), which mandates that Federal agencies ensure the quality, objectivity, utility, and integrity of the information used to form Federal guidance.</p><p>The NESR team collaborates with subject matter expert groups, such as the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee (the Committee), to conduct its systematic reviews using rigorous, protocol-driven methodology (<a class="bibr popnode" href="#bib2" rid="bib2">2</a>, <a class="bibr popnode" href="#bib3" rid="bib3">3</a>). To ensure that NESR's process remains state of the art, NESR has routinely evaluated and refined its methodology through a continuous quality advancement (CQA) initiative. When appropriate, refinements to the NESR methodology are carefully adopted. Process refinements reflect continuous evolution in both systematic review and nutrition science. NESR's CQA initiative promotes efficiency and maintains the credibility and high quality of NESR's work.</p><p>NESR has always included grading the strength of evidence as part of its systematic review methodology, and through its CQA initiative has made changes over time to the processes and criteria used in grading, most recently in 2018 before supporting the 2020 Committee (<a class="bibr popnode" href="#bib3" rid="bib3">3–5</a>). These changes reflect evolutions in the field of systematic review methodology while providing consistency in NESR's grading process across time and projects (<a class="fig-table-link figpopup" co-legend-rid="" href="/pmc/articles/PMC9340967/table/tbl1/" rid-figpopup="tbl1" rid-ob="ob-tbl1" target="table"><span><strong>Table 1</strong></span></a>). As part of its 2018 CQA initiative, the NESR team reviewed and compared methods from several organizations and engaged with methodologists from some of those organizations (<a class="bibr popnode" href="#bib6" rid="bib6">6–17</a>). The NESR team also considered the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) report, “Redesigning the Process for Establishing the Dietary Guidelines for Americans” (<a class="bibr popnode" href="#bib18" rid="bib18">18</a>).

This allows for careful consideration of the strengths and limitations of each study design included in the review. Study design is further taken into account through the grading element of risk of bias, described below, because NESR's process utilizes risk-of-bias tools that capture design-specific concerns.</p><p>The evidence from each respective design is assessed based on 5 grading elements: risk of bias, consistency, directness, precision, and generalizability. This assessment is facilitated using the NESR grading rubric (<a class="fig-table-link figpopup" co-legend-rid="" href="/pmc/articles/PMC9340967/table/tbl2/" rid-figpopup="tbl2" rid-ob="ob-tbl2" target="table"><span><strong>Table 2</strong></span></a>), which is publicly available on the NESR website (<a data-ga-action="click_feat_suppl" href="https://nesr.usda.gov/2020-dietary-guidelines-advisory-committee-systematic-reviews" ref="reftype=extlink&amp;article-id=9340967&amp;issue-id=413639&amp;journal-id=1420&amp;FROM=Article%7CBody&amp;TO=External%7CLink%7CURI" target="_blank">https://nesr.usda.gov/2020-dietary-guidelines-advisory-committee-systematic-reviews</a>) (<a class="bibr popnode" href="#bib2" rid="bib2">2</a>).

<strong>Risk of bias</strong> considers the likelihood that systematic errors resulting from the design and conduct of the studies could have affected the accuracy of the reported results across the body of evidence. In NESR's process, each included study undergoes a formal risk-of-bias assessment specific to the study design (<a class="bibr popnode" href="#bib2" rid="bib2">2</a>). These assessments of each individual study are documented, compiled, and used to inform consideration of risk of bias across the body of evidence.</div></li><li><div>
<strong>Consistency</strong> considers the degree of similarity in the direction and magnitude of effect across the body of evidence. This element also considers whether differences across the results can be explained by variations in study designs and methods. For example, the differences in the magnitude of effects across studies may be attributed to differences in population (e.g., baseline nutritional status), the intervention/exposure (e.g., dosage), or other study methods.</div></li><li><div>
<strong>Directness</strong> considers the extent to which studies are designed to directly examine the relation among the interventions/exposures, comparators, and outcome of primary interest in the systematic review question.</div></li><li><div>
<strong>Precision</strong> considers the degree of certainty around an effect estimate for a given outcome. This element considers measures of variability, such as the width and range of CIs, the number of studies, and sample sizes, within and across studies.</div></li><li><div>

Rather, each overall grade reflects the experts’ thorough consideration of all of the elements, as they each relate to the specific nuances of the body of evidence under review. In the text of the report, the experts describe their assessment of the grading elements which provides a transparent explanation of the overall grade selected.

First, the Committee was oriented to NESR's methodology during Committee meetings, which were open to the public, as well as administrative training meetings. In addition, NESR analysts provided training and guidance to the Committee throughout the duration of their work to ensure that grading was executed consistently in accordance with the NESR methodology.</p><p>During the Committee's process to grade the evidence, NESR analysts provided the information necessary for assessing each grading element, including extracted data, risk of bias assessments, a description of the body of evidence, and a drafted synthesis of the evidence. NESR analysts also provided support during the Committee's discussions on the body of evidence to ensure that all grading elements were discussed, that the conclusions and grades reflected the evidence reviewed, and that the rationale was transparently documented.</p><p class="p p-last">During public meetings, members of the Committee who supported a specific NESR systematic review presented and discussed the full systematic review, including the graded conclusion statements. For each NESR systematic review, the Committee described the evidence, explained the rationale for the grade, and addressed comments and questions from fellow Committee members. The public could participate in the process by submitting comments, which were reviewed and considered by the Committee. Finally, all systematic reviews were peer reviewed by government scientists (<a class="bibr popnode" href="#bib2" rid="bib2">2</a>). These layers of input further strengthened the grading process.</p></div><div class="sec sec-last" id="sec2-4"><h3 id="sec2-4title">Examples from the 2020 Committee</h3><p class="p p-first">The NESR grading process provides a framework that allows for the strength of the evidence to be rated in a systematic and transparent manner across NESR systematic reviews. This framework does not offer a “one size fits all” approach, but rather, it promotes consistency in the approach to grading, while offering flexibility that allows each body of evidence to be weighed against all of the grading elements. Despite the unique nature of the body of evidence underlying a conclusion statement, each grade conveys the same meaning regardless of the rationale (<a class="fig-table-link figpopup" co-legend-rid="" href="/pmc/articles/PMC9340967/table/tbl3/" rid-figpopup="tbl3" rid-ob="ob-tbl3" target="table"><span>Table 3</span></a>).

For folic acid, results were highly consistent, with each of the studies reporting that supplementation was associated with higher values on ≥1 measure of red blood cell folate. The assessment of generalizability for the dietary patterns evidence identified few or no concerns, whereas the assessment of the folic acid evidence identified some concerns, given that participants were from relatively high socioeconomic backgrounds, with little racial or ethnic diversity reported.

And, different conclusion statements developed as part of the same systematic review may receive different overall grades reflecting the evidence supporting those statements; the grades do not reflect evidence that is irrelevant to the conclusion statements. For example, a systematic review was conducted to answer the question, “What is the relationship between folic acid from supplements and/or fortified foods consumed before and during pregnancy and risk of hypertensive disorders during pregnancy?” Eight studies were included in the review: 3 RCTs, 2 nonrandomized controlled trials, and 3 prospective cohort studies (<a class="fig-table-link figpopup" co-legend-rid="" href="/pmc/articles/PMC9340967/table/tbl5/" rid-figpopup="tbl5" rid-ob="ob-tbl5" target="table"><span>Table 5</span></a>).

The evidence supporting this conclusion demonstrated good consistency and directly examined the exposure, comparator, and outcomes of interest. However, owing to a lack of evidence from RCTs and concerns related to risk of bias, precision, and generalizability, there was limited certainty in the conclusion. Evidence supporting the conclusion related to consumption of <span class="underline">folic acid supplements</span> by <em>women at low risk</em> was assigned a grade of moderate. This body of evidence included the 3 RCTs and 3 prospective cohort studies. This evidence was similar to that in high-risk women, in that it also had good consistency and directness, with some concerns related to precision and generalizability. However, this evidence received a grade of moderate, rather than limited, mostly owing to the inclusion of consistent evidence from RCTs and fewer risk-of-bias concerns.

NESR and these others rely on consideration of specific elements (<a class="bibr popnode" href="#bib2" rid="bib2">2</a>, <a class="bibr popnode" href="#bib9" rid="bib9">9</a>, <a class="bibr popnode" href="#bib21" rid="bib21">21</a>), sharing 4 of 5 grading elements in common: risk of bias, consistency, directness, and precision (<a class="bibr popnode" href="#bib9" rid="bib9">9</a>, <a class="bibr popnode" href="#bib22" rid="bib22">22–26</a>). All of these approaches take study design into consideration, and all assign an overall grade that communicates the strength of the evidence to decision makers and stakeholders (<a class="bibr popnode" href="#bib27" rid="bib27">27</a>). NESR's grading process differs in its consideration of study design, publication bias, and generalizability, given its role in informing public health nutrition decisions within the US government.</p><p>NESR systematic reviews include study designs that offer the strongest evidence with which to establish a relationship, including both RCT and nonrandomized designs. NESR recognizes that relying on RCTs is important, but also considers that rigorously conducted nonrandomized studies, such as prospective cohort studies, can provide important evidence that complements data from RCTs, particularly when RCTs are not feasible. The NESR grading process therefore considers the strengths and weaknesses of evidence within and across all included study designs. This process differs from others that begin with a set grade based on study design (e.g., RCT evidence begins with a grade of strong), and then adjust up or down based on the assessment of evidence (<a class="bibr popnode" href="#bib9" rid="bib9">9</a>, <a class="bibr popnode" href="#bib21" rid="bib21">21</a>).</p><p>NESR's systematic review methodology includes steps to assess the potential for publication bias, but publication bias is not a formal element in NESR's grading process. NESR recognizes the importance of publication bias in nutrition research and carefully evaluates and documents it during evidence synthesis and assessment. Publication bias may not effectively differentiate the strength of bodies of evidence, and there are not widely accepted, reliable methods for assessing publication bias and its impact on systematic review conclusions (<a class="bibr popnode" href="#bib9" rid="bib9">9</a>, <a class="bibr popnode" href="#bib24" rid="bib24">24</a>, <a class="bibr popnode" href="#bib28" rid="bib28">28</a>).</p><p>NESR's grading process has always included generalizability as a formal grading element. Because NESR systematic reviews are conducted to inform Federal nutrition policies and programs in the United States, it is imperative that they consider how generalizable the evidence is to Americans at the population level.</p><p class="p">Finally, NESR's grading process includes steps designed to transparently communicate the strength of evidence underlying each conclusion statement, which includes the grade followed by a specific complementary verb (e.g., “strong evidence demonstrates,” “limited evidence suggests”). This integration of the grade in the conclusion statement allows end users to clearly understand the certainty of evidence, and the likelihood it may change if new evidence emerges. NESR's process also accommodates situations in which no or insufficient evidence is available to develop a conclusion statement by allowing for “grade not assignable” to be used.</p><div class="sec sec-last" id="sec3-1"><h3 id="sec3-1title">Continued advancement of NESR's grading process</h3><p class="p p-first-last">NESR's grading process has evolved over time to remain state of the art, leveraging advances in both the fields of systematic review methodology and nutrition science. As noted in the NASEM report (<a class="bibr popnode" href="#bib18" rid="bib18">18</a>), appropriate standards or methods evolve and improve dynamically over time in response to advances in science. As part of NESR's commitment to quality advancement, the Committee provided feedback on their experience using NESR's systematic review process. Strengths identified included the utility of the NESR grading rubric, which was described by the Committee as objective, concise, and easy to use to assess grading elements. In addition, the Committee recommended that NESR publish its grading process to benefit others conducting nutrition-related systematic reviews. As part of NESR's CQA process, NESR staff will consider feedback from the Committee, continue to monitor advancements in grading approaches, and, when appropriate, update the NESR grading process.</p></div></div><div class="tsec sec" id="sec4"><h2 class="head no_bottom_margin" id="sec4title">Conclusion</h2><p class="p p-first">NESR's grading process provided a structured and transparent approach to assessing the strength of evidence underlying conclusion statements drawn as part of the systematic reviews conducted by the Committee on relations between nutrition and health outcomes. The process relied on consideration of 5 grading elements (risk of bias, consistency, directness, precision, and generalizability) as well as the study designs of included articles to determine and communicate the level of certainty in each conclusion drawn during the review process. The NESR grading process was designed to have specific utility in informing public health–related policy decisions relevant to Americans at the population level.</p><p class="p p-last">Over time, NESR's grading process has evolved, and it will continue to evolve to remain state of the art, leveraging advances in both the fields of systematic review methodology and nutrition science. NESR's process aligns with methods used by other organizations that conduct systematic reviews to inform decision making, ensuring that decisions made related to nutrition and public health are based on the strongest available evidence.</p></div><div class="tsec sec" id="ack1"><h2 class="head no_bottom_margin" id="ack1title">ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</h2><div class="sec"><p>We thank current and former staff on the Nutrition Evidence Systematic Review team including Charlotte Bahnfleth, Marlana Bates, Gisela Butera, Natasha Cole, Meredith Higgins, Julia Kim, Julie Nevins, Sara Scinto-Madonich, and Sudha Venkatramanan.
